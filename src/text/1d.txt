Hello! I'm Matt, but
everyone just calls me the
'Worried Explorer'.

I came from a faraway region
called Glitchland, looking
for big treasure.

I noticed a strange
formation of scattered
Pok@ Balls next to Fuchsia.

They seem really out of
place... I think there's
something hidden around that
area.

If you discover something
new, please let me know!
