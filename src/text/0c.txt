Great!
So the question I got...

Train A travels at constant
speed. Train B departs one
day later, traveling in the
same direction at twice the
speed of train A.

Train B makes a twenty
minute stop for every hour
it travels, but train A
travels without any stops.

How many stops will train B
make before it catches up
to train A, including the
stop where they meet up?
