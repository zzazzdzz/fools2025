Ah, this place really takes
me back...

It really looks like
Glitchland from way back in
the day.

I often come back here, just
to experience these brief
moments of nostalgia.

Glitchland has changed so
much over the years... but
this place, it somehow
remains the same.

Wanna know more about
Glitchland? Hear me out...
