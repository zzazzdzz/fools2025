Hmm, yes!
That's a Master Ball!

Oh yeah... The taste...
The smell... The texture...

Thank you! I can't help but
wonder where did you find
this rare specimen.

This reminds me of a certain
person I met a while back.

They used some sort of item,
and then, a pile of Master
Balls appeared right in front
of my eyes, out of nowhere!

I couldn't believe it.
How does that even work?
