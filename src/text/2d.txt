Wow, this Card Key I have
sure is great!

Wait, you want one too?
Maybe there are options.

I'll just activate my Pot of
Greed magic card. It allows
me to draw two additional
cards and add them to hand!

Ah, none of them are Card
Keys...

Well, the Pot of Greed magic
card is great, but it isn't
an actual Magic card!

I'll use Ancestral Recall,
making you draw three cards!

Oh my, you got pretty lucky.
You drew a Card Key!
